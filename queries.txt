Basic Queries (test single table lookups)

  1. "List all legendary perks"
  2. "What weapons do the most damage?"
  3. "Show me all chest armor pieces"

  Join Queries (test relationships between tables)

  4. "What perks work with the Gauss shotgun?"
  5. "Show me all Strength perks and their effects at each rank"
  6. "What legendary perks affect heavy weapons?"

  Aggregation/Grouping (test complex SQL)

  7. "How many weapons are in each weapon class?"
  8. "What's the average damage resistance for each armor set?"
  9. "Which SPECIAL attribute has the most perks?"

  Edge Cases (test error handling)

  10. "What perks affect the Death Star?" (non-existent weapon)
  11. "Show me armor with 1000+ damage resistance" (probably no results)
  12. "What is the best energy weapon?" (vague query requiring interpretation)

  Complex Logic (test query generation)

  13. "Compare the Combat shotgun vs Pump action shotgun"
  14. "What's a good build for stealth rifles?"
  15. "Show me all Secret Service armor pieces with their stats"

  Reserved Keywords (test your backtick escaping)

  16. "What does Gunslinger do at rank 3?" (already tested, but good to retest)
  17. "Show me all perks sorted by rank"

  Data Validation (test data quality)

  18. "What armor sets are available?" (test set_name grouping)
  19. "Show me all automatic weapons" (test weapon_class filtering)
  20. "What perks require level 50 or higher?"

  Try a mix of these - especially the edge cases and complex queries. They'll help identify issues with:
  - Empty result handling
  - SQL syntax generation
  - Data type mismatches
  - Complex JOIN conditions
  - Proper use of GROUP BY
  - Handling ambiguous questions
