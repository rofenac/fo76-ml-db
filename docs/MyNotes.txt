When asking about a build, the LLM should ask about things like: Is this for a stealth build? It will help inform the LLMs response.

---------------

The explanation at the end of the query should know definitive things like multiple damage values correlate to different weapon levels and should enumerate those levels. Example:

"Based on the database results, the **Pipe revolver** has the following damage output:

**51 / 57 / 65 / 83 / 105 / 134 / 171**

The damage values appear to represent different tiers or upgrade levels, with damage ranging from 51 at the lowest level up to 171 at the highest level."

---------------

General explanations of human vs. ghoul character would be helpful. Maybe a general explanation of basic game machanics?

--------------


I asked, "What is the best two handed weapon in the game and it erred out. When the user asks vague questions like that, maybe prompt the LLM to ask followup questions to clarify the user's intent. "What do you mean by best?" It could be something simple like best damage aka highest base damage, or something more complex like the best overall based on user defined criteria which the LLM could tease out of the LLM.

  MySQL vs Vector DB: Different Jobs

  MySQL (Keep Forever)

  - Source of truth for all game data
  - Stores actual attributes: damage values, resistance stats, form IDs, URLs, etc.
  - Handles structured queries: filtering, sorting, joins, aggregations
  - Powers exact lookups: "Show me all Heavy armor with DR > 300"
  - Enforces data integrity with foreign keys and constraints

  Vector DB (New Addition)

  - Search index for semantic similarity
  - Stores numerical representations (embeddings) of your data
  - Enables concept matching: "stealth weapon" matches items even if they don't contain the word "stealth"
  - Finds similar items: "weapons like the Fixer"
  - Does NOT store actual data - just pointers back to MySQL

  Example: How They Work Together

  User asks: "What's a good weapon similar to the Fixer for stealth?"

  1. Vector DB: Finds semantically similar weapons
    - Encodes "Fixer" and "stealth" as embeddings
    - Returns weapon IDs: [15, 42, 89, 103] (semantically similar)
  2. MySQL: Fetches actual data for those weapons
  SELECT * FROM v_weapons_with_perks
  WHERE id IN (15, 42, 89, 103);
    - Returns: Handmade Rifle (id=15), Railway Rifle (id=42), etc.
    - With damage, perks, class, all attributes
  3. Claude: Formats answer using real data from MySQL

  Why You Need Both

  | Task                                 | Best Tool                           |
  |--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
  | "Show shotguns with damage > 100"    | MySQL (structured filter)           |
  | "Find weapons similar to Fixer"      | Vector DB → MySQL (semantic + data) |
  | "What's the DR of T-65 chest piece?" | MySQL (exact lookup)                |
  | "Recommend a bloodied build"         | Vector DB → MySQL (concept search)  |
  | "List all Strength perks"            | MySQL (exact attribute match)       |
  | "Best weapon for my playstyle"       | Vector DB → MySQL (fuzzy matching)  |

  What Changes in Your Project

  Stays the Same:

  - ✅ MySQL database with all tables (weapons, armor, perks, etc.)
  - ✅ All scrapers continue populating MySQL
  - ✅ query_engine.py still works for structured queries
  - ✅ Database views (v_weapons_with_perks, etc.)

  New Additions:

  - ➕ Vector database (ChromaDB) as a search index
  - ➕ Embeddings layer to convert text → vectors
  - ➕ Hybrid query engine that routes queries appropriately
  - ➕ One-time population script to sync MySQL → Vector DB

  Synchronization:

  When you add new weapons to MySQL, you'd also:
  # Add to MySQL (existing workflow)
  cursor.execute("INSERT INTO weapons ...")

  # Also add embedding to vector DB (new step)
  embedding = embedder.generate_weapon_embedding(weapon_data)
  vector_store.add_weapon(weapon_id, embedding, metadata)

  Think of It Like Google

  - MySQL = Your website's actual pages (source of truth)
  - Vector DB = Google's search index (helps find relevant pages)

  Google doesn't store your website's content - it stores an index that points back to your pages. Same concept here.

  ---
  TL;DR: MySQL stays forever as your source of truth. Vector DB is just a smart index layer on top of it for semantic search. You keep both and they work together.

------------------------

1. Hybrid Storage Architecture (What I Recommended)

  MySQL Database          Vector Database
      (f76)          +      (ChromaDB)
        ↓                       ↓
   Structured data      Semantic search index
   (source of truth)    (pointers to MySQL)

  This is keeping your MySQL database AND adding a vector database alongside it.

  2. Hybrid Query/Search Strategy (How You Use Them)

  The HybridFalloutRAG class I showed combines:
  - SQL-based retrieval (exact matches, filters)
  - Vector-based semantic search (similarity, concepts)

  class HybridFalloutRAG:
      def ask(self, question):
          if self._needs_semantic_search(question):
              # Use vector search → then get data from MySQL
              return vector_search_then_sql()
          else:
              # Use existing SQL-based RAG
              return self.sql_rag.ask(question)

  Compared to the Other Options:

  Option A: Standalone Vector DB

  - Replace MySQL entirely with just ChromaDB/Weaviate
  - ❌ Not recommended - you'd lose structured querying power
  - ❌ Harder to maintain data integrity

  Option B: MySQL Extension

  - Use MySQL 9.0's built-in vector support
  - Store embeddings as a column in your existing tables
  - ⚠️ Limited - MySQL's vector features are basic compared to dedicated vector DBs
  - ⚠️ Requires MySQL 9.0+ (you're likely on 8.0)

  Option C: Hybrid Storage ✅ (What I Described)

  - Keep MySQL for all structured data
  - Add ChromaDB/FAISS for semantic search
  - Best of both worlds
  - Industry standard for production RAG systems

  ---
  So yes, when I laid out the detailed implementation with hybrid_query_engine.py, ChromaDB, and keeping MySQL - that's the "Hybrid Storage" option (Option C) in
  action.

  Think of it as:
  - Storage layer: Hybrid (MySQL + Vector DB)
  - Query layer: Hybrid (SQL + Vector search)
  - Result: Best tool for each type of question
