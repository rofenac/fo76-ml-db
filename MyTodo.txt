When asking about a build, the LLM should ask about things like: Is this for a stealth build? It will help inform the LLMs response.

The explanation at the end of the query should know definitive things like multiple damage values correlate to different weapon levels and should enumerate those levels. Example:

"Based on the database results, the **Pipe revolver** has the following damage output:

**51 / 57 / 65 / 83 / 105 / 134 / 171**

The damage values appear to represent different tiers or upgrade levels, with damage ranging from 51 at the lowest level up to 171 at the highest level."
